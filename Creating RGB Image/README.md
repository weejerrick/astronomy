# Creating RGB Images

Colouring astronomical images is the one of the most basic skills that astronomers must learn.

Here are two possible ways to colour the images:
1. Using APLpy (the Astronomical Plotting Library in Python; https://aplpy.github.io/)
2. The Lupton Method using astropy (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/382245)
